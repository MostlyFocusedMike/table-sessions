# Table Sessions 
A times table practice site that doesn't look like it was made for 4th graders

## Project Goals 
This project was a little different in that it was mostly for a practical use (I'm rusty with my times tables) and for design practice. 
I wanted more practice using pure JS before jumping into MVC's and Frameworks and whatnot, but I also really wanted to focus 
on making a really cool looking, modern site. Especially since every other times table site looks like it's for children only,
no adults allowed. Table Sessions is designed to be sleek, modern, and focused on the user experience. 
Its look and style will ensure you can practice quickly and efficiently without distractions or complicated menus to navigate.

## Notes 
I have a similar CLI python times tables program I built on my phone, but it was interesting to convert that logic into JS. 
Mainly because JS has no "wait for user input" function, so the way I dealt with looping had to be broken up. Figuring out a light-weight
way to do progress bars that keep up with users (even as they skip rounds) was also a nice little challenge, and I believe I have 
come up with a good solution.
